# express_implementing_routes

In this module, we practiced using Express scaffolding
Learned to make modular folders for middleware, routes, and variables
Modularly organized file and folder for an express app

Practiced using RESTful methods using curl

Created input validators inside of Routes to make sure we are accepting only a certain type of data, and to avoid malicious attacks

I love Expres. It's very simple and there are so many ways A developer can customize it using all of the different npm modules and the ability to create our own specific middleware!
